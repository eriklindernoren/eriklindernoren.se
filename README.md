# My Personal Website

#### About
This website was built primarily for the purpose of learning myself web development. I love design,
sketching and building stuff and this was a great way of getting practice doing all those
three things. Since this was my introduction to web development I decided to build it using only 
vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.
